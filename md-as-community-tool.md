## GitHub

Campus Champions has created a repository for this tutorial. https://github.com/CampusChampions/markdown-intro

Upon visiting this site, arguably the most noticable thing on the page with be the contents of the **README.md** document.

In many GitHub repositories, there is a **Wiki** tab.

GitHub allows you to host static webpages. You can even do this without learning Git. 
**GH-Pages** hosts webpages such as the [ACI-REF's site](https://aci-ref.github.io/facilitation_leading_practices/) and Dirk Colbry's [CyberAmbassadors site](https://colbrydi.github.io/cyberambassadors/).

An example: http://docpantry.cirruspublications.com/doc-template/

Lives in GitHub: https://github.com/wendikristine/documentation-template/blob/gh-pages/doc-template.md

## GitBook

An example: https://template.cirruspublications.com/

The content can be edited directly in GitBook (or with the downloadable GitBook Editor), or it can be linked to a GitHub repository.
